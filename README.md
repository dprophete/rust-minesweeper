why?
===
Still learning rust... This is quite similar to my other [tetris](https://github.com/dprophete/rust-tetris) game, but different enough that it was still a good learning experience.

Not to mention that I have very fond memories of playing this game back in the early days of windows 95...

run
===
`cargo run`
